# Home-Credit-Default-Risk-Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/data

In this competition, I am tasked with predicting clients' future payment behaviors based on raw data that includes application details, demographics, and historical credit information. Rather than working with pre-processed, aggregated data, I am starting with detailed monthly and credit-level data. This format allows me to explore various ways of structuring the data and to experiment with different levels of feature engineering. My approach will involve carefully selecting and crafting features to capture meaningful trends and patterns in client behavior, as well as testing different machine learning models to see if advanced feature engineering, or a simpler model approach, yields better results. To assist with this process, I am using the provided column descriptions to ensure I make informed decisions when creating and selecting features.
